# Hi there ðŸ‘¾

I'm a computer engineering student, based in Istanbul. I have a keen interest in overall technology and science but I'm currently focusing on mobile development and design. I have experience with various mobile development frameworks and I really enjoy creating dummy apps & games. I'm also into art and design. I'm familiar with most of the Adobe Creative tools and Figma. Don't know how you reached this adress in the world wide web but, I hope you like my work. Thnx
