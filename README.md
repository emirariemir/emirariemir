### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering graduate and software developer based in Istanbul, focused on frontend and mobile application development. My main stack is React Native with TypeScript and iOS apps with Swift. Along the way, Iâ€™ve worked with tools like Kotlin, Flutter, and Unity, giving me a strong cross-platform perspective.

I enjoy building smooth, user-focused mobile experiences and have hands-on experience extending apps with native modules, iOS & Android widgets, and even watchOS companion apps.

Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge in AI, computer vision and machine learning, with an interest in how intelligent systems can enhance everyday mobile products.
