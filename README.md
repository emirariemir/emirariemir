Hi. I'm a Senior Computer Engineering student based in Istanbul, graduating in 2025. I’m interested in mobile technology and enjoy building apps with Swift, React Native, and Flutter. My focus is on creating smooth and functional mobile experiences.

Lately, I’ve been exploring computer vision and machine learning. I plan to deepen my skills in these areas through higher education. I'm especially curious about how intelligent systems can be used in everyday products especially how it can integrated to our smartphones.

I also have a strong background in design. I enjoy working where art and technology meet. I create digital illustrations, UI/UX designs, and motion graphics using tools like Figma, Procreate, and Adobe Creative Suite. I’m particularly interested in generative AI and how it can be used in creative workflows.
